1. Successor nodes are inserted at front of the fringe (successor list) as a node is expanded. Is this a breadth (LIFO) or depth-first search (FIFO)?

Answer:
    
    It is according to the picture, 
    Depth-first search that inserts successor nodes at front of 
    the fringe as node is expanded. 

2. For goal J, give the fringe (successor list) after expanding each node.

Answer:

3. What is the effect of inserting successor nodes at the end of the fringe as node is expanded? 
A depth or breadth-first search?

Answer:

    The effect is that it uses the breadth-first search, which expands all the nodes up in front, 
    and then expands all the next nodes in the next row of nodes. This gives an overview of all the possible successor nodes.

4. For goal J, give the fringe (successor list) after expanding each node.
